abstract = {Photoinduced optical anisotropy of azobenzene-containing polymers has emerged as a source of exciting optical phenomena with a range of potential applications. Here we show that the benefits of the guest-host and covalently-linked systems can be combined by exploiting specific non-covalent interactions between the dye molecules and the polymer host. More precisely, hydrogen bonding between the dye and the polymer host enables to use high dye concentrations compared to conventional guest-host polymers and also improves the temporal stability of the anisotropic alignment of the dyes. We studied the photoinduced anisotropy of a common azo-dye, Disperse Red 1 (DR1), doped in polystyrene (PS) and poly(4-vinylphenol) (PVPh).},

abstract = {We show that strong noncovalent interactions between a host polymer and guest dye molecules drastically suppress the dye aggregation tendency, thereby allowing high doping levels, which in turn opens possibilities for enhanced performance. We use a common azo-dye (Disperse Red 1) and three polymer matrixes: polystyrene (PS), poly(4-vinylphenol) (PVPh), and poly(styrenesulfonic acid) (PSSA). The polymer-dye systems are studied in thin films by ultraviolet-visible and infrared spectroscopy and by optical second-harmonic generation. The lack of interaction in PS-matrix limits the maximum obtainable dye loading without aggregation below 20 wt {\%}. Due to the polar nature of PVPh matrix, ca. 40 wt {\%} dye loading can be achieved without aggregation, whereas in PSSA an ionic complex is formed, allowing ca. 60 wt {\%} loading. In the latter case a dye molecule is attached to approximately each polymer unit, which has typically required covalent bonding of dye molecules to the polymer. This motivates further studies of noncovalently interacting guest-host systems as a general route for functional optical materials},

abstract = {The authors study the photoresponsive behavior of thin films of supramol. 4-nitro-4'-hydroxyazobenzene-poly(4-vinylpyridine) complexes. Hydrogen bonding between phenol and pyridine moieties allows attaching a chromophore to essentially each repeat unit of the polymer, thereby suppressing macroscopic phase sepn. and crystn. Moreover, the noncooperative nature of hydrogen bonding leads to random complexation of the chromophores to the polymer backbone, which enables a systematic study of the effect of chromophore concn. on the photoorientation of the complexes. Two regimes are obsd.: photoinduced birefringence increases linearly with the chromophore concn. until nominally every third polymer repeat unit is occupied. Beyond that concn., a new regime is obsd. with a drastically steeper slope of increase. The latter regime is connected to the interplay between the formation of a hydrogen-bonded supramol. complex and intermol. interactions between the mesogenic chromophores. Such a behavior significantly enhances the birefringence at high concns. and also leads to high remnant birefringence. Hence, the supramol. approach yields a superior optical performance compared to guest-host polymers and even surpasses the properties of many covalently functionalized polymers, while still allowing modular tunability of the materials properties. on SciFinder(R)},

Stable gratings with modulation depth as high as 440 nm and with diffraction efficiency exceeding 40{\%} were inscribed in the equimolar complexes. Our results demonstrate that phenol-pyridine hydrogen bonding not only allows one to increase the chromophore content until each polymer unit is occupied but is also sufficiently strong to induce mass migration of the polymer chains in a manner comparable to covalently functionalized polymers.},

Materials tested included Spenco, Poron, nylon-reinforced silicone, Soft Pelite, Medium Pelite, Firm Plastazote, Regular Plastazote, and Nickelplast. A displacement-controlled testing device was constructed to assess the CS of 11.1 mm diameter material specimens under cyclic loading (1 Hz) to 220 kPa over 10- and 60-min periods. Results demonstrated local CS ranging from 687 kPa (Poron) to 3,990 kPa (Soft Pelite). To fit the cyclic stress-strain (S-S) data within an error of 4.0 percent full-scale output, the minimum order of fit required for Spenco, Poron, and nylon-reinforced silicone was a third-order polynomial; for Soft Pelite, Medium Pelite, Firm Plastazote, and Regular Plastazote, a second-order polynomial; and for Nickelplast, a linear fit. For all materials, the nonrecovered strains were related to loading time using an exponential fit. A biaxial force-controlled load applicator device was used to assess COF at skin-material, sock-material, and skin-sock interfaces for shear forces of 1 to 4 N applied to a 10.2 x 7.8 mm loading pad. COFs ranged from 0.48 (+/- 0.05) to 0.89 (+/- 0.09). COFs at skin-material interfaces were significantly (p {\textless} 0.05) higher than those at skin-sock interfaces. There was a trend of a higher COF at sock-material interfaces than at skin-sock interfaces. These data are of potential utility in finite element modeling sensitivity analysis of residual limb-prosthetic socket systems or body-orthosis systems to characterize effects of material features on interface pressure and shear stress distributions.},

abstract = {The photomechanical behavior of crosslinked azobenzene-containing liquid-crystalline polymer films was investigated by means of simultaneous measurement of their optical and mechanical properties. The connection between photoisomerization of the azobenzene moieties, photoinduced change in molecular alignment, photoinduced stress generation, and macroscopic bending was analyzed. Upon UV irradiation, the films exhibited bending due to gradient in cis-azobenzene content, and subsequent unbending when cis-azobenzene content became uniform throughout the film. The maximum photoinduced stress was generated in the same time scale as the time required to reach photostationary state in the cis-azobenzene concentration. The maximum values of photogenerated stress strongly depended on the crosslinker concentration, even if the azobenzene concentration and the cis-azobenzene content in the photostationary state were similar for all the polymer films. The stress is connected to the initial Young's modulus and also to the photoinduced change in birefringence of the polymer films. In addition, a significant photoinduced decrease in Young's modulus was for the first time observed in crosslinked azobenzene-containing liquid-crystalline polymers, which is likely to be an important factor in dictating their photomechanical behavior.},

However, its directionality renders it unique compared to ubiquitous hydrogen bonding.

In particular, it is shown that light-induced surface patterning, a unique phenomenon occurring in azobenzene-containing polymers, is more effi cient in halogen-bonded pol- ymer–azobenzene complexes than in the analogous hydrogen-bonded com- plexes. A systematic study is performed on a series of azo dyes containing different halogen or hydrogen bonding donor moieties, complexed to poly(4- vinylpyridine) backbone. Through single-atom substitution of the bond-donor, control of both the strength and the nature of the noncovalent interaction between the azobenzene units and the polymer backbone is achieved. Impor- tantly, such substitution does not signifi cantly alter the electronic properties of the azobenzene units, hence providing us with unique tools in studying the structure–performance relationships in the light-induced surface deforma- tion process.

abstract = {Halogen bonding is an emerging noncovalent interaction for constructing supramolecular assemblies. Though similar to the more familiar hydrogen bonding, four primary differences between these two interactions make halogen bonding a unique tool for molecular recognition and the design of functional materials. First, halogen bonds tend to be much more directional than (single) hydrogen bonds. Second, the interaction strength scales with the polarizability of the bond-donor atom, a feature that researchers can tune through single-atom mutation. In addition, halogen bonds are hydrophobic whereas hydrogen bonds are hydrophilic. Lastly, the size of the bond-donor atom (halogen) is significantly larger than hydrogen. As a result, halogen bonding provides supramolecular chemists with design tools that cannot be easily met with other types of noncovalent interactions and opens up unprecedented possibilities in the design of smart functional materials. This Account highlights the recent advances in the design of halogen-bond-based functional materials. Each of the unique features of halogen bonding, directionality, tunable interaction strength, hydrophobicity, and large donor atom size, makes a difference. Taking advantage of the hydrophobicity, researchers have designed small-size ion transporters. The large halogen atom size provided a platform for constructing all-organic light-emitting crystals that efficiently generate triplet electrons and have a high phosphorescence quantum yield. The tunable interaction strengths provide tools for understanding light-induced macroscopic motions in photoresponsive azobenzene-containing polymers, and the directionality renders halogen bonding useful in the design on functional supramolecular liquid crystals and gel-phase materials. Although halogen bond based functional materials design is still in its infancy, we foresee a bright future for this field. We expect that materials designed based on halogen bonding could lead to applications in biomimetics, optics/photonics, functional surfaces, and photoswitchable supramolecules.},

abstract = {Azopolymers comprise a unique materials platform, in which the photoisomerization reaction of azobenzene molecules can induce substantial material motions at molecular, mesoscopic, and even macroscopic length scales. In particular, amorphous azopolymer films can form stable surface relief patterns upon exposure to interfering light. This allows obtaining large-area periodic micro- and nanostructures in a remarkably simple way. Herein, recent progress in the development of azopolymer-based surface-patterning techniques for photonic applications is reviewed. Starting with a thin azopolymer layer, one can create a variety of photonic elements, such as diffraction gratings, microlens arrays, plasmonic sensors, antireflection coatings, and nanostructured light-polarization converters, either by using the azopolymer surface patterns themselves as optical elements or by utilizing them to microstructure or nanostructure other materials. Both of these domains are covered, with the aim of triggering further research in this fascinating field of science and technology that is far from being harnessed.},

abstract = {The supramolecular assembly of photoactive azobenzenes with passive polymers via halogen or hydrogen bonding is a cost-effective way to design materials for various photomechanical applications that convert light energy directly into macroscopic motion, for instance, in all-optical surface patterning and photochemical imaging of plasmonic structures. To elucidate the molecular-level origins of this motion, we show, by coupling dynamic infrared spectroscopy to a photo-orientation setup, that supramolecular bonds above a certain interaction strength threshold are photostable under vigorous photoisomerization cycling and capable of translating the photo-orientation of azobenzenes into the orientation of nonabsorbing host polymer side chains. A correlation is found between azobenzene photoinduced molecular orientation and macroscopic all-optical surface patterning efficiency. The improved performance of halogen-bonded systems in photopatterning applications can be related to the absence of a plasticizing effect on the polymer matrix, which may enable the material to retain an optimal glass transition temperature, in contrast to hydrogen-bonded and nonbonded references. Thus, our results provide design guidelines in terms of the nature and strength of the supramolecular interaction and of the degree of azo functionalization needed to optimize the motion transfer to passive polymers. {\textcopyright} 2015 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {The formation of the surface relief gratings (SRG) in azo-polymers strongly depends on the polarization configuration of the writing beams. So far the s−s polarization configuration has been considered as ineffective in terms of SRG formation. Here, we report that very high-amplitude SRGs can be recorded when using the s−s inscription geometry in supramolecular polymer−azobenzene complexes and that the efficiency of the process strongly depends on the molecular weight of the polymer. Furthermore, a single holographic irradiation leads to the formation of the surface relief grating (primary grating) and, unexpectedly, to the formation of the secondary fine-structure grating with a considerable modulation depth in the direction perpendicular to the primary grating. The detailed analysis of holographic recording has been performed on the basis of the proposed phenomenological model. A new aspect of the phenomenon of the SRG formation has been indicated by demonstrating that the SRG can be inscribed for the s−s polarization configuration. Since the SRG formation is considered as an important new tool in micro/ nanofabrication technologies, both the formation of the SRG for s−s geometry and the formation of the fine-structure grating open new possibilities in photonic applications.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 American Chemical Society. Light-responsive supramolecular self-assemblies exhibit interplay between order and dynamics of the self-assembling motifs, through which the thermal isomerization rate of azobenzene chromophores can be tuned by orders of magnitude. By using supramolecular complexes of 4-(4-alkylphenylazo)phenols hydrogen-bonded to poly(4-vinylpyridine) as model systems, we demonstrate that the thermal isomerization rate of the hydroxyazobenzene derivatives increases 5700-fold when the material undergoes a transformation from a disordered, low-azobenzene-concentration state to a high-concentration state exhibiting lamellar, smectic-like self-assembly. Drastically smaller thermal isomerization rates are observed in disordered structures. This allows us to attribute the change to a combination of increased number density of the hydroxyazobenzenes inducing plasticization, and cooperativity created by the chromophore-chromophore interactions through self-assembled molecular order and alignment. Our results pinpoint the importance of molecular self-assembly and intermolecular interactions in modifying the dynamics in supramolecular complexes in a controlled manner.

However, in the large systems often encountered in supramolecular chemistry and biosciences, large basis sets can make the calculations far too slow. Therefore, small basis sets, which would combine high computational speed and high accuracy, are in great demand. This study focuses on comparing how well density functional theory (DFT) methods employing small, double-zeta basis sets can estimate halogen-bond strengths. Several methods with triple-zeta basis sets are included for comparison. Altogether, 46 DFT methods were tested using two data sets of 18 and 33 halogen-bonded complexes for which the complexation energies have been previously calculated with the high-accuracy CCSD(T)/CBS method. The DGDZVP basis set performed far better than other double-zeta basis sets, and it even outperformed the triple-zeta basis sets.

To this purpose, a plethora of noncovalent interactions are available, spanning a wide range of strengths, specificities, and directionalities. 1,2 The high-fidelity assembly of small molecules into discrete supermolecules requires strong and directional interactions, such as metal coordination that takes advantage of the predictable nature of metal-ligand coordination and ligand ability to encode directionality. 3 A wide diversity of 2D (e.g., triangles, squares, rectangles, and rhomboids) and 3D systems, (e.g., pyramids, prisms, cubes, etc.) have been reported. 4-8 On the other hand, polygonal supramolecular architectures assembled via weaker interactions, such as hydrogen bonding, are much less common. Only a few examples of hydrogen-bonded supramolecular triangles have been reported, mostly relying on double hydrogen bonding patterns involving nucleotides. 9-14 A triangle may be prepared by the combination of three 601 donor units and three 1801 acceptors. Alternatively, the donor and acceptor units may be mounted over the same molecular scaffold at the angle of 601, and the triangular shape results from the high-fidelity self-complementary assembly. Inspired by this latter design, we reasoned that the halogen bond (XB), namely the noncovalent interaction involving halogen atoms as electrophilic sites, may possess the strength, specificity, and high directionality required to result in such self-assembly. 15-19 To the best of our knowledge, only two examples of halogen-bonded triangles have been reported in the literature. Bowling and co-workers 20 have exploited intramolecular XB between aryl halide donors and several neutral XB-acceptors, held in proximity by 1,2-aryldiyne linkers, to build-up a family of supramolecular triangular structures in the solid state. Furthermore, we found in the CSD ‡ that 2,4,5-triiodo-1-methyl-1H-imidazole 21 packs in the crystalline state into halogen-bonded triangular motifs (Scheme 1). These examples inspired our design towards larger halogen-bonded triangular macrocycles. We anticipate the larger size to yield accessible voids within the triangles, a clear advancement compared to the previous reports. Here we report that 2-iodoethynylpyridine and 2-iodoethynyl-1-methyl-imidazole self-assemble under halogen-bonding control forming discrete macrocycles, viz. supramolecular triangles. The design principles to obtain a triangular halogen-bonded macrocycle are: (i) starting building blocks with a rigid planar structure, (ii) self-complementary XB-donor and acceptor groups directed along the sides of an equilateral triangle, Scheme 1 The trimeric triangular motif observed in the crystal structure of 1-methyl-2,4,5-triiodoimidazole (left) and the molecular building blocks used in this study (right), bearing both XB-donor and XB-acceptor sites within the same molecular scaffold.},

abstract = {Abstract A versatile, laser-projector-based method is demonstrated for programming alignment patterns into monolithic films of liquid crystal polymer networks. Complex images can be photopatterned into the polymer films with sub-100 µm resolution, using relatively short exposure times. The method is further used to devise both photochemically and photothermally driven actuators that can undergo distinct light-induced shape changes, dictated by the programmed alignment patterns. Deformation modes such as buckling and coiling, as well as miniature robotic devices such as a gripper and a light-responsive octopod, are demonstrated. The reported technique enables easy and cost-effective programmable actuation with relatively high throughput, thus significantly facilitating the design and realization of functional soft robotic actuators.},

@article{Poutanen2018,
abstract = {Photoisomerization of azobenzene derivatives is a versatile tool for devising light-responsive materials for a broad range of applications in photonics, robotics, microfabrication, and biomaterials science. Some applications rely on fast isomerization kinetics, while for others, bistable azobenzenes are preferred. However, solid-state materials where the isomerization kinetics depends on the environmental conditions have been largely overlooked. Herein, an approach to utilize the environmental sensitivity of isomerization kinetics is developed. It is demonstrated that thin polymer films containing hydroxyazobenzenes offer a conceptually novel platform for sensing hydrogen-bonding vapors in the environment. The concept is based on accelerating the thermal cis–trans isomerization rate through hydrogen-bond-catalyzed changes in the thermal isomerization pathway, which allows for devising a relative humidity sensor with high sensitivity and quick response to relative humidity changes. The approach is also applicable for detecting other hydrogen-bonding vapors such as methanol and ethanol. Employing isomerization kinetics of azobenzenes for vapor sensing opens new intriguing possibilities for using azobenzene molecules in the future.},
